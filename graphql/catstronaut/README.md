# Catstronaut: Apollo Graphql Hands-On Training

This project was developed by following the [Apollo Graphql Hands-On Training](https://odyssey.apollographql.com/lift-off-part1/feature-overview-and-setup)

There are 2 main folders:

- `server`: The starting point of our GraphQL server.
- `client`: The starting point of our React application.

To get started:

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
1. Run `yarn`.
1. Run `yarn start`.

This will start the GraphQL API server.

In another Terminal window or tab,

1. Navigate to the `client` folder.
1. Run `yarn`.
1. Run `yarn start`.

This will open up `localhost:3000` in your web browser.
